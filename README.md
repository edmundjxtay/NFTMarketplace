# NFT Marketplace

In this project, we'll be building a decentralized marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) â€“ unique digital assets that are stored on the blockchain. This project will provide us with hands-on experience in deploying smart contracts, integrating with IPFS for decentralized storage, and building a user interface to interact with the marketplace.

Key Components:
1. Smart Contract Development:
We'll develop a Solidity smart contract using the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities for creating, listing, and selling NFTs. The smart contract is equipped with features like tracking NFT ownership, listing prices, and executing NFT sales.

2. Integration with IPFS:
Utilize IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and efficient storage of NFT metadata.
Implement functions to upload NFT images and metadata to IPFS, enhancing the overall decentralization of the marketplace.

3. Frontend Development:
Build a user-friendly frontend using React.js to interact with the smart contract and IPFS.
Create pages for listing NFTs, displaying user profiles, and showcasing individual NFT details.
Implement features for users to list their NFTs for sale and purchase NFTs from others.

4. Blockchain Interaction:
Use the MetaMask wallet for development, allowing users to connect their wallets to the marketplace.
Develop functions to retrieve NFT data from the smart contract and display it on the frontend.
  
5. User Authentication:
Implement user authentication mechanisms, allowing users to sign up and log in to the marketplace.
Secure user data and ensure a personalized experience with features such as user profiles.

6. Testing and Deployment:
Test the functionality of the smart contract and frontend components.
Deploy the smart contract on the Goerli testnet using Hardhat.
Utilize Alchemy for blockchain data management and integration with the frontend.
