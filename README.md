# NFT Marketplace

In this project, you'll be building a decentralized marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) – unique digital assets that are stored on the blockchain. This project will provide you with hands-on experience in deploying smart contracts, integrating with IPFS for decentralized storage, and building a user interface to interact with the marketplace.
Key Components:
1. Smart Contract Development:
• You'll develop a Solidity smart contract using the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities for creating, listing, and selling NFTs.
• The smart contract is equipped with features like tracking NFT ownership, listing prices, and executing NFT sales.
2. Integration with IPFS:
• Utilize IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized and efficient storage of NFT metadata.
• Implement functions to upload NFT images and metadata to IPFS, enhancing the overall decentralization of the marketplace.
3. Frontend Development:
• Build a user-friendly frontend using React.js to interact with the smart contract and IPFS.
• Create pages for listing NFTs, displaying user profiles, and showcasing individual NFT
details.
• Implement features for users to list their NFTs for sale and purchase NFTs from others.
4. Blockchain Interaction:
• Use the MetaMask wallet for development, allowing users to connect their wallets to the marketplace.
• Develop functions to retrieve NFT data from the smart contract and display it on the frontend.
  
5. User Authentication:
• Implement user authentication mechanisms, allowing users to sign up and log in to the marketplace.
• Secure user data and ensure a personalized experience with features such as user profiles.
6. Testing and Deployment:
• Test the functionality of the smart contract and frontend components.
• Deploy the smart contract on the Goerli testnet using Hardhat.
• Utilize Alchemy for blockchain data management and integration with the frontend.

By completing this master project, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of building a decentralized NFT marketplace, covering smart contract development, IPFS integration, frontend design, and blockchain interactions. This project serves as a valuable hands-on experience in blockchain development and decentralized application (DApp) creation. Good luck, and enjoy the journey of bringing your NFT marketplace to life!
